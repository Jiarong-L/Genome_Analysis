1. Go to eggnogdb's website
2. Upload 'export.aa' from MAKER round 1's output (since it's the only valid one)
3. Choose 'DIAMOND', since HMMER doesn't work (maybe my file is not suitable to do any hmm stuff)
4. Use default settings
5. Output see: http://eggnogdb.embl.de/#/app/emapper?jobname=MM_8IFoTk
